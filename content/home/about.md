As we have done in our prior edition, we will step back and try to grasp the concepts involved in the emerging practices. What challenges are seen as an old problem within a new context? What makes prior solutions not work? What brand new concepts and techniques will be born as a result?

Last but not least, we will hold a panel discussing the future of LLM models in enterprise applications. Our goal is to understand future trends, e.g., small specialized models vs. large more general models, need for fine-turning, how to building trust and reliability in solutions.
